# Weather Visualization Rebase

Welcome to the Weather Visualization Rebase repository! This project, developed in collaboration with [Rebase Energy](https://www.rebase.energy/) and the [Information Visualization course at KTH](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2321?l=en), offers a dynamic platform for wind farm management by integrating geospatial insights, energy analytics, and weather data to improve decision making for power traders. Our platform is designed to empower wind farm operators with comprehensive insights, enabling informed decisions for optimized energy trading. We seamlessly integrate geospatial insights, energy analytics, and real-time weather data to empower your decision-making.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Visualize and sort wind farms based on energy production, capacity, and location. Apply filters by price areas and select different weather models and layers, such as temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity.

- **List Farms Information:** Access detailed performance metrics of wind farms, with capabilities to sort and filter based on specific criteria such as price areas.
